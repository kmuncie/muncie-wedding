                            In the new system we will have a giant gathering on top of a mountain meadow where we will enjoy great food and spend hours
                            talking and sharing stories of our lives and how Jehovah has blessed us.
                        p.
                            For now however, we must be modest and live within our means. The Watchtower has some wonderful articles on how to
                            #[a(href="http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2006767") increase the joy and dignity of a wedding], and we have studied these numerous times
                            in our family worship. For that reason we have attempted to keep our wedding very small and modest. 
                            We have no bridal party, we are trying to invite only around 50-75, and the reception will be a small simple affair.
                        p.
                            Instead of inviting hundreds of you to the expense of travel, lodging, and our inevitable desire to provide an unforgettable event, we 
                            would much rather have a small dignified wedding which will bring honor to Jehovah and the marriage arrangement... and then have many smaller gatherings
                            in the coming months where we can enjoy your company and love in a meaningful way.
                        p.
                            We are saying many prayers that you will understand our reasons for these decisions and know how much we truly do love each of you and
                            look forward to enjoying the rest of our lives with you doing many wonderful things together. Thank you for your support and for caring
                            about us both so much!

                    Because of our situation at Bethel we are in need of very little physically.
                    The only things we need are more vacation days and money for times of need.
                    If you would like to help us in that way you can do so by means of a check or 
                    sending money without fees through an app called Square Cash 
                    (#[a(href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/square-cash/id711923939?mt=8") Apple] or #[a(href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareup.cash") Android]).
